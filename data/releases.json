The applied crop will be centered on the frame e.g. a horizontal crop of 1600px on a 1920px original frame will remove 160px on the left-hand side and 160px on the right hand side. Crop offset : The offset in pixels to apply to the crop rectangle. Offsetting the crop rectangle more than half the crop size in an axis will cause the crop rectangle to shrink in order to stay within the original frame. This functionality is useful for use cases such as when a camera produces non-16:9 output over SDI which is restricted to 16:9, resulting in black bars. The black bars can be cropped out with this feature. Productions using anamorphic lenses will also benefit from this feature. For more information about video in cropping, see setup-video-input",

    "description": "2.5D has been possible with Designer prior to r26.3, however, it required the manual creation of plates using a projection surface per plate, manually applying specific settings to each plate, and the use of a StageRender layer. With r26.3, 2.5D has been made a first-class citizen in Designer with its own layer type and the concept of a 2.5D asset. This dramatically increases the usability and speeds up the workflow, as well as making it more intuitive and less error-prone",

At launch, the Cuebric scene is exported from Cuebric by clicking on Plug & Play 3D in the Segmentation view under the Depth option. Once exported, follow the 2p5D workflow to set up a 2.5D asset from an existing .2p5d file.vWhen the Cuebric export includes AI-generated depth mapping information, Designer will auto-generate a 3D mesh from the depth data to add shape to the plates. To remove the depth mapping from the plate, you can simply select the standard rectangle mesh instead in the plate properties",
