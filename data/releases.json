Offsetting the crop rectangle more than half the crop size in an axis will cause the crop rectangle to shrink in order to stay within the original frame.\nThis functionality is useful for use cases such as when a camera produces non-16:9 output over SDI which is restricted to 16:9, resulting in black bars. The black bars can be cropped out with this feature. Productions using anamorphic lenses will also benefit from this feature.\nFor more information about video in cropping, see setup-video-input",
