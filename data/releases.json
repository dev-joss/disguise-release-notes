Starter is designed for learning and so it will always output with watermarks, but it will run on servers, laptops, PCs and can do full network and session control, including RenderStream and OmniCal. Starter comes with its own free perpetual license built in, but it does require that you log in to your Disguise Cloud account in d3Manager to launch projects. Remember, Starter projects use the file extension: .d3starter and cannot be opened in the un-watermarked Full version of Designer, so if you’re working on a production that will eventually output from a server, you’ll need a Pro license and to use Full. You can read more about Starter here."

To utilise this preview feature you can enable the option switch “forcePIDTimecodeChase”. Chasing LTC or any kind of timecode will smoothly follow adjustments to timecode playback while this is set. If you perform large timecode jumps you may find that the playhead will fast-forward to get to the new timecode rather than immediately jump to that point."

It is important to note the following mitigations with this feature: Object hierarchies found within the FBX file in Designer are currently not supported. FBX files imported with up to 3x UV maps are supported. Designer uses the first UV map only and there is currently no way to switch between each UV map."

The previously existing V1 API, found at /api/v1, should be considered deprecated as of the launch of the stable API set under the Service and Session APIs. New API integrations should not target the V1 API and should instead use the APIs documented under /api/service and /api/session. No new APIs or functionality will be added to V1, however the V1 API will be maintained for the foreseeable future and we will give notice if we plan to remove it in the future."
