Remember, Starter projects use the file extension: .d3starter and cannot be opened in the un-watermarked Full version of Designer, so if you’re working on a production that will eventually output from a server, you’ll need a Pro license and to use Full.

New API integrations should not target the V1 API and should instead use the APIs documented under /api/service and /api/session.
