The applied crop will be centered on the frame e.g. a horizontal crop of 1600px on a 1920px original frame will remove 160px on the left-hand side and 160px on the right hand side.\nCrop offset: The offset in pixels to apply to the crop rectangle. Offsetting the crop rectangle more than half the crop size in an axis will cause the crop rectangle to shrink in order to stay within the original frame.\nThis functionality is useful for use cases such as when a camera produces non-16:9 output over SDI which is restricted to 16:9, resulting in black bars. The black bars can be cropped out with this feature. Productions using anamorphic lenses will also benefit from this feature.\nFor more information about video in cropping, see setup-video-input",

    "description": "P - Promote propSelectionPriority == 10 as default behaviour\nSelection of objects in the Designer visualiser is prioritised based on the type of object. For example, if a camera is behind a projector, the camera will be selected even if the projector is visually in front. In previous releases, the Prop object had the lowest selection priority of all object types. This could be changed with the option switch propSelectionPriority. In this release, the default selection priority of Props has been changed so it is the same priority as a projector, puck, skeleton and 2.5D asset. It is still possible to use the option switch to change this, whereby setting propSelectionPriority to 0 is the lowest priority and 25 is the highest priority.",

If you perform large timecode jumps you may find that the playhead will fast-forward to get to the new timecode rather than immediately jump to that point\nIf you have feedback about this new preview feature please let us know via our support@disguise.one email so that we can take that into account for the finished implementation.",
